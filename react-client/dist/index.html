    <h3>IF IT FITS YOUR MACROS 101</h3>
    <p>
        Macros, short for "macronutrients," is the term used to describe the three major (or macro) nutrients: protein, carbohydrates, and fat. Rather than placing all of your attention on counting calories or demonizing certain macronutrients, IIFYM focuses on meeting daily macro goals. Done correctly, this provides a consistent calorie intake, but one that can be personalized in endless different ways.
        
        At first glance this may seem needlessly complicated: "Why count three different things when I can count just one?" The answer is that by emphasizing specific amounts of each macronutrient (and choosing quality sources), you can better tailor it to your lifestyle, tastes, and goals.

      <h3>Origins</h3>
      <p>The IIFYM diet was originally designed by fitness enthusiast Anthony Collova after he became frustrated with traditional dieting recommendations.

          IIFYM is a new spin on dieting that focuses on macronutrients rather than calories.
          
          Macronutrients, or macros, are the four types of food molecules the body can break down for energy. Three types of macronutrients are tracked in IIFYM:
          
          Protein, which has 4 calories per gram.
          Carbohydrates, which have 4 calories per gram.
          Fat, which has 9 calories per gram.
          Alcohol is the fourth macronutrient, containing 7 calories per gram, but it is not included in the IIFYM diet.
          
          Following the IIFYM diet is pretty simple, and only requires a few steps:
          
          Calculating your macros: Calculations are used to determine how many grams of protein, carbs and fat you need each day in order to meet your weight goals.
          Meeting your macros: Once you know your macros, you just need to stay within them each day. Food intake is tracked and adjusted as needed.
          Since all foods are allowed, many people consider this diet a welcome change from strict calorie counting or eliminating entire food groups.</p>
